The tool uses transaction files which can be exported from the broker. Currently Degiro is only supported 
but other platforms and their transaction exports are intended to be supported in future.

The tool combines portfolio performance analyzing capabilities and tax report aid for Finland's tax 
authority [vero.fi](https://www.vero.fi). The tax report outputs are most likely valid and useful for other 
tax authorities as well but these are not supported. Author takes no responsibility in mistakes or invalid 
values in the tax report output and the user shall take full responsibility for their tax report.
